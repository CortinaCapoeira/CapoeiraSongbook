    Welcome to this Capoeira Songbook. 
</p>
<div>
    <p>
        This project started off as a pdf songbook as a way to learn new songs (and remember which songs I knew!), but after I shared it with the group it seems to be a useful tool and this seems to be the best way to keep an up to date version for people to use.
