    Welcome to this Capoeira Songbook. 
</p>
<div>
    <p>
        This project started off as a pdf songbook as a way to learn new songs (and remember which songs I knew!), but after it was shared with the group it seems to be a useful tool and this seems to be the best way to keep an up to date version for people to use.

        We would love for this project to be a collaboration and we have some ideas for how this can be extended and grow. If you have any ideas, or you want to contribute please get involved.
