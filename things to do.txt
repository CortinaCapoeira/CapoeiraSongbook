*** touchscreen big / computers - Layout for screen sizes
*Text/Narrative on home page to welcome people properly
* use electron-pdf to generate pdf file to export website
** this seems to not work easily, we might want to use something else
** there is wkhtmltopdf but it seems to not work that well
** pandoc is probably good if we are willing to use latex
** seems thgat the easiest option would be to use puppeteer: https://blog.risingstack.com/pdf-from-html-node-js-puppeteer/
*** puppeteer has the same problem as electron-pdf, even specifying --no-sandbox, so we really need to try again to use a different user
*** i can't remember why we didn't do it, i know that using sudo didn't work, but maybe specifying the user in the docker image import(in the yaml as property) might work
