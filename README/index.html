<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>At it's core, this project is a collection of capoeira songs that we sing in our group, all in one location for easy reference.
However we intend to expand on this and use the songs as a base to expore the wider history of capoeira.</p>
<h2>How it's built/Contributions</h2>
<p>This project is a static website built using eleventyjs. The generated website get deployed to the gh-pages branch, served by github.</p>
<p>The songs are added by creating a .json file in the _data/songs folder.</p>
<p>We are always open to suggestions, from fixing typos, to adding songs, translations and other information so feel free to look at the project and contribute!</p>
