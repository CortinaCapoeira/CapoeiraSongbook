# Welcome to the Capoeira Songbook!

## About the project

At it's core, this project is a collection of capoeira songs that we sing in our group, all in one location for easy reference. 
However we intend to expand on this and use the songs as a base to expore the wider history of capoeira.

## How it's built/Contribtuions

This project is a static website built using eleventyjs. The generated website get deployed to the gh-pages branch, served by github.

The songs are added by creating a .json file in the \_data/songs folder. 

We are always open to suggestions, from fixing typos, to adding songs, translations and other information so feel free to look at the project and contribute!
